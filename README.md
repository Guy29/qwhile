#### What is this?
A quine for Neil Jones's WHILE language, the original version of which was given in his book [Computability and Complexity](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262100649/computability-and-complexity/), as modified and popularized by Bernhard Reus in his [Limits of Computation](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-27889-6).

#### How do I test it?
You will need Alex Jeffery's [hwhile](https://github.com/alexj136/HWhile) interpreter, and optionally Python to run the `tester.py` script.
